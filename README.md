Desktop App for artists that need a random image viewer with a timer.

To use it you just have to
1. Click on "Select Directory"
2. Choose from which folder will be showing all the images.
3. Click on "Settings" and select a time option.
4. Finally, click on "Start!"

You can also stop the timer at any time clicking on "Stop!" button from the Settings menu. Or you can get another image with the "Next Image" Button, as getting the last image with the "Previous Image" as well.

This is a small app, but I want to develop it further with new features in the future. Hope you can use it and find it helpful when you want to practice drawing with __your own images as references__.
